```

The React frontend communicates with the FastAPI backend through REST APIs and WebSockets.

The FastAPI backend manages business logic, authentication, database operations, notifications, route optimization, and real-time operations.

PostgreSQL stores application data.

Celery handles background and scheduled processing.

# Notification Configuration

FleetFlow currently supports two notification channels.

| Channel | Provider | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| In-App | FleetFlow | Application notification records |
| Email | Gmail SMTP | Operational email notifications |

## Notification Events

### Vehicle Assignment

When a driver is assigned to a vehicle, FleetFlow creates an in-app notification and sends an email notification to the driver.

### Trip Started

When a trip enters the `IN_PROGRESS` state, FleetFlow creates an in-app notification and sends a trip-start email.

### Shipment Status

When a shipment status changes, FleetFlow can create an operational notification and send an email notification to the assigned driver.

### Route Recalculation

When a route is recalculated or changed, FleetFlow creates an operational notification and sends an email notification to the assigned driver.

---

# Email Notifications

FleetFlow uses Gmail SMTP for email delivery.

Email notifications contain:

- Notification title
- Notification message
- FleetFlow branding
- HTML formatting
- Plain-text fallback

The email implementation provides a simple professional notification layout instead of sending unformatted plain-text messages.

---

# Environment Configuration

## Backend Environment

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory.

```env
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql-database-url>

JWT_SECRET_KEY=<jwt-secret>

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=<your-gmail-address>
SMTP_PASSWORD=<your-google-app-password>
```

### Important

Use a Gmail App Password for SMTP authentication when required.

Never commit:

- `.env`
- Database passwords
- JWT secrets
- Gmail passwords
- API keys
- Private credentials

---

## Frontend Environment

The current frontend does not require Firebase or Twilio notification configuration.

If additional frontend environment variables are required by the application, configure them according to `frontend/.env.example`.

---

# Prerequisites

Before running FleetFlow, install:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js
- npm
- PostgreSQL
- Git

For background processing:

- Celery
- A supported Celery message broker/configuration

---

# Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

```powershell
cd backend
```

Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install backend dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure the backend `.env` file.

Run database migrations:

```powershell
alembic upgrade head
```

Start the FastAPI development server:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

The backend will normally be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

# Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```powershell
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the Vite development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server will display the local frontend URL in the terminal.

---

# Database Setup

FleetFlow uses PostgreSQL as its primary relational database.

Configure the database connection through:

```env
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql-database-url>
```

Run database migrations:

```powershell
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

Alembic manages database schema migrations.

---

# Celery Background Processing

FleetFlow uses Celery for background and scheduled processing.

## Start Celery Worker

```powershell
celery -A app.celery_app:celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO --pool=solo
```

## Start Celery Beat

```powershell
celery -A app.celery_app:celery_app beat --loglevel=INFO
```

Celery is used for scheduled and background operational tasks such as maintenance monitoring.

---

# API Documentation

FleetFlow uses FastAPI for its backend API.

When the backend is running, FastAPI provides interactive API documentation.

## Swagger UI

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

## ReDoc

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
```

These interfaces can be used to inspect and test available API endpoints.

---

# Real-Time Tracking

FleetFlow supports real-time vehicle tracking using WebSockets.

The tracking workflow includes:

1. Vehicle location generation or GPS simulation
2. Backend location processing
3. WebSocket communication
4. Frontend live location updates
5. Map visualization
6. Delivery and trip progress monitoring

This allows fleet operators to monitor vehicle movement without repeatedly refreshing the application.

---

# Route Optimization

The route optimization module provides:

- Route calculation
- Route optimization
- Route recalculation
- Traffic-aware optimization
- Optimization criteria
- Dynamic route updates

When a route changes, the assigned driver can receive an in-app and email notification.

---

# Maintenance Processing

Maintenance management includes:

- Maintenance scheduling
- Maintenance records
- Maintenance monitoring
- Maintenance alerts
- Maintenance reporting

Celery background processing can be used for scheduled maintenance monitoring.

---

# Analytics

FleetFlow provides operational analytics covering:

- Fleet utilization
- Fleet performance
- Driver performance
- Delivery performance
- Fuel consumption
- Operational KPIs

The analytics dashboard provides a centralized view of fleet operations.

---

# Reports

FleetFlow supports report generation and export in:

- PDF
- Excel

Reports can be used for fleet performance, maintenance, delivery, and operational analysis.

---

# Security

FleetFlow implements:

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Protected backend endpoints
- Environment-based configuration
- Database authentication
- Secure SMTP credential configuration

Sensitive credentials must always remain outside source control.

---

# Testing & Verification

The following major workflows were verified during development:

- Backend startup
- Frontend production build
- Database connectivity
- Vehicle assignment
- Driver workflows
- Trip start workflow
- Shipment status updates
- Route optimization
- Route recalculation
- In-app notifications
- Gmail SMTP email notifications
- GPS tracking/simulation
- Real-time tracking
- Maintenance workflows
- Analytics workflows
- Report generation
- Celery processing

## Backend Compilation Check

Backend Python modules were validated using:

```powershell
python -m compileall app -q
```

## Frontend Production Build

The frontend production build was validated using:

```powershell
npm run build
```

## Git Validation

Git whitespace validation was performed using:

```powershell
git diff --check
```
